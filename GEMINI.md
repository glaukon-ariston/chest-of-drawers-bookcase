# Gemini Project: Chest of Drawers Bookcase

This project contains the OpenSCAD code for a chest of drawers with an integrated bookcase.

## Coding Guidelines

* Do not use magic constants. Instead, give the value a descriptive name and define a constant.
* Do not delete items from the TODO.md file.
* When writing Python code, separate functions with two empty lines.
* Do not silently change code that I have manually changed.
* This is important, I will repeat this again. Do not delete or modify code that I changed without consulting with me first.
* Use `Write-Output` instead of `Write-Host` in PowerShell programming.
* Avoid catching exceptions. Prefer propagating exceptions and making program fail as soon as possible.
* Do not use `git add` and `git commit` without user's permision.

### Structure

*   **Corpus:** The corpus is made of `melanine_thickness_main` thick melanine and consists of two sides, a top, a bottom and a middle plate. The corpus is divided into two compartments. The bottom compartment contains six drawers and the top compartment is a bookcase with two shelves.
*   **Drawers:** The drawers are made of `melanine_thickness_secondary` thick melanine and are mounted to the sides of the corpus with slides. Each drawer has a front panel made of `melanine_thickness_main` thick melanine. Dowel holes are included in the side and bottom panels for joining with the front panels. The drawer assembly has been fixed, and handle holes have been added to the drawer fronts.
*   **Shelves:** The bookcase has two shelves made of `melanine_thickness_main` thick melanine.
*   **HDF Back Panel:** A 3mm HDF back panel is attached to the back of the corpus.
*   **Pedestal:** A 30mm high pedestal is placed under the corpus.
*   **Glass Doors:** The bookcase section is enclosed by two glass doors.
*   **Joinery:** Confirmat screws (4.8mm x 49mm) are used to join the corpus panels and shelves. 4mm pilot holes for these screws are included in the model. The drawer components are also joined with these screws, with the number of screws depending on the panel length (2 for <50cm, 3 for >=50cm) and placed 5cm from the edge. Wooden dowels (phi 6 mm x 30 mm) are used to join the front panels to the drawer boxes. The front's blind hole is 1cm deep. There are two dowels per panel per side if the panel length is less than 50cm, and four dowels if longer, with even spacing. The hole locations are 5cm from the edge. Pilot holes for mounting the drawer slides are included in both the drawer sides and the corpus sides. These holes are 2mm deep and 2.5mm in diameter. In drawer sides, there are two holes per slide, located 35mm and 163mm from the front edge. ... In corpus sides, there are six holes per slide, located 6.5mm, 35mm, 51mm, 76, 99mm, and 115mm from the front edge.

### Cut List Generation

The model can generate a CSV cut list for all panels. This is controlled by the `generate_cut_list_csv` variable in `model.scad`. A PowerShell script, `generate-csv.ps1`, is provided to automate the process of generating the `artifacts/cut_list.csv` file.

### CNC Export

The project includes a workflow for exporting 2D panel drawings in DXF format, suitable for CNC cutting services. The `workflow.ps1` script automates the entire export process. It dynamically creates a unique export directory for each model configuration based on its dimensions (e.g., `export/H2300xW600xD230_Mm19_Ms12`). The `export-panels.ps1` script automates the export of all panels, and the `run-split-layers.ps1` script (which calls `split-layers-dxf.ps1` and `split_layers.py`) post-processes the DXF files to separate geometry into `CUT`, `DRILL`, and `DIMENSION` layers, and adds annotations for holes. The exported panels are positioned at the origin (0,0) to ensure consistency. The annotations include a detailed "Hole Schedule" table with the hole name, diameter, depth, and its X, Y, and Z coordinates.

#### DXF to DWG Conversion

The `split-layers-dxf.ps1` script also handles the conversion of the layered DXF files to DWG format using the ODA File Converter in batch mode.

#### DXF to PDF Conversion

A PowerShell script, `convert-dxf-to-pdf.ps1`, is provided to convert the layered DXF files to PDF format using LibreCAD. Due to a known issue where LibreCAD's `dxf2pdf` tool returns an incorrect exit code on success, the script verifies the conversion by checking for the creation of the output PDF file rather than relying on the exit code.

## Iverpan Order Generation

A Python script, `create_order.py`, is provided to automate the creation of an order document for the Iverpan cutting service. The script uses the generated cut list CSV file and an Excel template to create a new Excel file with the order details.

## Workflow

The `workflow.ps1` script automates the entire export and conversion process. It dynamically creates a unique export directory for each model configuration based on its dimensions (e.g., `export/H2300xW600xD230_Mm19_Ms12`). The script performs the following steps:

1.  **Generates the CSV cut list.**
2.  **Exports all panels to DXF, STL, and SVG formats.**
3.  **Splits the DXF files into layers.**
4.  **Converts the layered DXF files to DWG.**
5.  **Converts the layered DXF files to PDF.**
6.  **Generates order files for Iverpan and Elgrad.**

## Known Issues

*   The bounding box calculation for text entities in `split_layers.py` is not accurate. It only considers the insertion point, which may result in incorrect placement of dimensions and legends in some cases.

### v5

*   **Enhanced Hole Visualization in DXF Export:**
    *   The `split_layers.py` script now includes the Z-coordinate in the text annotations for side-drilled holes (holes where the Z-coordinate is non-zero), providing clearer manufacturing information.
    *   A small cross symbol is now added at the (X,Y) location of side-drilled holes on the `DRILL` layer in 2D panel projections, serving as a visual indicator to distinguish them from through-holes or face-drilled holes.

### v4

*   Added a `DIMENSION` layer to the DXF export for panel and hole dimensions.
*   The dimensioning logic is optimized to avoid overlapping lines and redundant information.
*   Dimension text is now placed above the dimension line with a background fill for better readability.

### v3

*   Corrected the 2D hole coordinate calculation for DXF export to fix issues with reflected coordinates.

*   The Z-coordinate in the hole metadata now correctly distinguishes between perpendicular and edge-drilled holes.

### v2

*   The number of drawers is now configurable.
*   The drawer assembly has been fixed. The back panel of the drawer is now correctly positioned.
*   The model has been made more parametric.
*   Added 4mm pilot holes for confirmat screws to join the drawer components.
*   The file `prompt/model-v2.md` has been added to reflect the changes in the model.

*   Updated the cut list to include CNC comments.
*   Added a CNC export workflow using PowerShell and Python scripts to generate layered DXF files.
*   Fixed SVG export for panels with non-through holes by ensuring the holed face is on the `z=0` plane during projection.
*   Added a PowerShell script `split-layers-dxf.ps1` to automate the layering of DXF files.
*   Added a Python script `analyze_dxf.py` to analyze the layers in the generated DXF files.
*   Removed in-model text annotations for hole dimensions and locations to speed up DXF export.
*   The `split_layers.py` script now adds annotations to the DXF files based on the hole metadata exported from OpenSCAD.
*   Added a hole metadata export feature to generate CSV files with hole locations, which are then used to create annotations in the DXF files.
