The front panel's drill holes for dowels and the handle needs to be offset vertically to account for the bottom overlap (front_overhang). Currently these holes are placed half a secondary melanine thickness (5mm) off the bottom edge. This is not correct as it does not take into the consideration the overhang. The 3D model shows the overhang correctly but the 2D projection does not.

Also, the dowel drill holes need to line up with the corresponding holes in the drawer's box (side panel and the bottom panel). This is not the case. For example, the top side hole on the front panel is positioned 50mm from the front panel's top edge. This cannot be correct as the front panel is higher than the drawer box. The top hole in the drawer box is 50mm from the drawer side panel's top edge.

This is relevant for all front panel types: top, standard, bottom and inside and outside templates.
