Move the bottom hole in the drawer's side panels from being 50 mm from
the edge to being 35 mm from the edge in order not to interfere with  
the slide mechanism. The bottom hole is for connecting the drawer's   
side panel to the drawer's back panel. There also other connecting    
holes in the side pane and these do not need to be modified.
