Create pilot holes in drawer sides for fixing drawer slides. The holes should be 2mm deep and 2.5mm wide. There are two holes running on the slide's central line. The first hole is 35mm from the front edge and the second hole is 163mm from the front edge. Create constants with descriptive names for all the specified dimensions.
