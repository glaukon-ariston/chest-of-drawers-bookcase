Create pilot holes in corpus sides for fixing drawer slides. The holes should be 2mm deep and 2.5mm wide. There are six holes running on the slide's central line. The holes' offsets from the front edge are as follows: 6.5mm, 35mm, 51mm, 76mm, 99mm, and 115mm. Create constants with descriptive names for all the specified dimensions.
