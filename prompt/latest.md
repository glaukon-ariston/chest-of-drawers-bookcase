The drawer fronts are joined to the drawer box assembly with round wooden dowels 6mm x 30mm. Create 6mm holes for wooden dowels in both fronts and drawer's side and bottom panels. The front's blind hole should be 1cm deep. There should be two dowels per panel per side if the panel length is less than 50cm, four dowels if longer, and the hole locations should be 5cm from the edge. The dowels will be glued.
