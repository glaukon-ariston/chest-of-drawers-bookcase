The issue is that OpenSCAD is exporting circles as polylines. Address this by modifying split_layers.py to detect and convert these polylines back into CIRCLE entities. The plan is to add a new function, get_polyline_center_and_radius, which will identify closed polylines with more than 8 vertices and all points equidistant from a calculated center. Then, within the split_layers function, add a post-processing step to iterate through the collected entities, use this new function to find circle-like polylines, and replace them with the proper CIRCLE entities on the DRILL layer. Start by reading the latest version of split_layers.py.
