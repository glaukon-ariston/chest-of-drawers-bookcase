docs: Update installation instructions in README

The installation section in README.md has been updated to provide more specific and accurate links and names for the required software and extensions.

- The link for OpenSCAD now points to the Windows downloads page, and a separate link for the nightly build has been added.
- "VS Code Extrension" has been corrected to "VS Code Extensions" and a link to the Visual Studio Code website has been added.
