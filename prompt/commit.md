feat: Add pilot holes for drawer slides

This commit introduces pilot holes in the drawer sides for attaching the drawer slides.

- Added descriptive constants for pilot hole dimensions (depth, diameter, and distances).
- Created a `slide_pilot_hole` module for the new holes.
- Modified the `drawer_side` module to include the pilot holes on both left and right sides.
- Updated documentation to reflect these changes.
