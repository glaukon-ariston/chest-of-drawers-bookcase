# export-panels.ps1
#
# This script automates the export of all panels from the model.scad file
# to the export/$modelIdentifier directory for a specified export type (DXF, STL, or SVG).
# It iterates through a list of panel names obtained from the OpenSCAD model,
# and for each panel, it executes OpenSCAD to generate the corresponding
# output file. For DXF exports, it also attempts to extract hole metadata
# from OpenSCAD's console output and save it as a separate CSV file.
#
# Output file formats:
# - DXF: AutoCAD Drawing Exchange Format. Contains 2D geometry of panels,
#        including cut lines and drill holes. For DXF exports, a companion
#        CSV file is generated containing detailed metadata for each hole.
# - STL: Stereolithography (Standard Tessellation Language). Represents 3D
#        surfaces as a collection of triangular facets. Used for 3D printing
#        or viewing 3D models.
# - SVG: Scalable Vector Graphics. An XML-based vector image format for
#        two-dimensional graphics.
