> The drawer fronts are joined to the drawer box assembly with round wooden dowels 6mm x 30mm. Create 6mm holes for wooden dowels in both fronts and drawer's side and bottom panels. The front's blind hole should be 1cm deep. There should be two dowels per panel per side if the panel length is less than 50cm, four dowels if longer, and the hole locations should be 5cm from the edge. The dowels will be glued.

### Model

Okay, I will add 6mm holes for wooden dowels to join the drawer fronts to the drawer box assembly. I will modify the `model.scad` file to implement this change. First, I need to read the `model.scad` file.

I have modified the `model.scad` file. The changes should now reflect the addition of dowel holes for joining the drawer fronts with the drawer boxes.

> Replace magic constant for 50cm panel length with a descriptive constant name.

### Model

Okay, I'll replace the magic constant `500` with a descriptive constant name. I'll name it `panel_length_for_four_dowels` and set its value to 500. Then I'll update the `drawer_bottom` and `drawer_front` modules to use this new constant.

I have replaced the occurrence in `drawer_bottom`. Now I need to replace the one in `drawer_front`.

I have replaced the magic constant in the `drawer_bottom` and `drawer_front` modules. I'm now finished with the request.

### Model

I have replaced the magic constant `500` with the new variable `panel_length_for_four_dowels` in both `drawer_bottom` and `drawer_front` modules.

> The dowel holes are not rotated correctly. They are placed sideways instead of perpendicular.

### Model

You are absolutely right. My apologies, I have made a mistake in the rotation of the dowel holes. They are indeed placed sideways. I will correct the rotation of the holes in the `drawer_side` and `drawer_bottom` modules to be perpendicular to the panels.

First, I will read the `model.scad` file.

I have already executed the `replace` command for `drawer_side`. I need to execute the `replace` command for `drawer_bottom` as well.

### User

> The middle two holes related to the drawer bottom are not evenly spaced out with respect to other holes.

### Model

The user is correct; the middle dowel holes in the `drawer_bottom` module are not evenly spaced. I need to adjust their positions to ensure uniform distribution.

My plan is to calculate the positions for four evenly spaced holes, taking into account the `dowel_hole_edge_distance` from each end of the `drawer_body_width`. I will then update the `drawer_bottom` module with these new calculations.

First, I'll read the `model.scad` file.

I have corrected the spacing of the dowel holes in the `drawer_bottom` module.
I am done with the user's request.

### User

> Now you need to update the fronts too in order for the holes to be aligned.

### Model

You're right, the `drawer_front` module needs to be updated to align with the `drawer_bottom` changes. I'll adjust the dowel hole positions in `drawer_front` to match the new even spacing logic. This involves recalculating the x-coordinates based on the `drawer_body_width` and `dowel_hole_edge_distance`. I'll start by reading the file.

I have updated the `drawer_front` module to align the dowel holes with the `drawer_bottom`.
I am done with the user's request.

> Update the @prompt/model-v2.md file with the recent changes and design decisions.

### Model

I need to update the `prompt/model-v2.md` file to reflect the recent changes and design decisions.

Here's a summary of the changes I've made:
1.  **Added Dowel Parameters:** Introduced `dowel_diameter`, `dowel_radius`, `dowel_length`, `dowel_hole_depth_in_front`, `dowel_hole_edge_distance`, and `panel_length_for_four_dowels`.
2.  **Updated `dowel_hole` Module:** Modified the `dowel_hole` module to accept a `height` parameter.
3.  **Corrected Dowel Hole Rotation:** Fixed the rotation of dowel holes in `drawer_side` and `drawer_bottom` modules to be perpendicular to the panels.
4.  **Improved Dowel Hole Spacing:** Implemented even spacing for four dowel holes in `drawer_bottom` and `drawer_front` modules when the panel length exceeds `panel_length_for_four_dowels`.

I will update the "Joinery" section, specifically the "Wooden Dowels" subsection, to reflect the new dowel parameters, hole depth, edge distance, and the logic for two/four dowels based on panel length. I will also update the "Drawer" and "Drawer Fronts" sections to mention the dowel holes.

5.  **Updated `prompt/model-v2.md`:** Documented all these changes in the model description.

I will update the "Main Dimensions" section to include the new dowel parameters.
I will update the "Drawers" section to mention the dowel holes and their joining method.
