> Create pilot holes in corpus sides for fixing drawer slides. The holes should be 2mm deep and 2.5mm wide. There are six holes running on the slide's central line. The holes' offsets from the front edge are as follows: 6.5mm, 35mm, 51mm, 76mm, 99mm, and 115mm. Create constants with descriptive names for all the specified dimensions.

### Model

I will add the pilot holes for the drawer slides. First, I'll define the constants for the hole dimensions and offsets. Then, I'll modify the `corpus_side` module to create the holes and update the `corpus` module to correctly position them on both sides.

### User

> Do not delete the previous constants related to slides pilot holes. They are for the drawer side, these new ones are for the corpus side. Name and rename the constants appropriatelly to reflect this requirement.

### Model

You are right. I should have noticed that. My apologies. I will correct my approach.

I will rename the existing slide pilot hole constants to specify they are for the drawer side. Then, I will add the new constants for the corpus side pilot holes. I will also create separate modules for the drawer and corpus pilot holes to ensure clarity and correctness. Finally, I will modify the `corpus_side` and `corpus` modules as planned.

### User

> Use the array syntax for the drawer slide pilot holes too.

### Model

Understood. I will use the array syntax for the drawer slide pilot holes to maintain consistency. I will now proceed with all the planned modifications.

### User

> Use the common constants for pilot hole depth, diameter and radius.

### Model

Excellent point. Using common constants for shared dimensions is a much better approach. I will update the code to use a single set of constants for the pilot hole dimensions and specific offset arrays for the drawer and corpus sides. This will simplify the code and improve maintainability. I will now proceed with this refined plan.

### Model

Now that I've updated the constants, I'll proceed with the other changes.

First, I'll update the `corpus_side` module to add the pilot holes. Then I'll update the `corpus` module to correctly call the modified `corpus_side` module. Finally, I'll update the `drawer_side` module to use the new array for the drawer slide pilot hole offsets.

I will start with the `corpus_side` module.

### Model

Okay, updating the `corpus` module now.

### Model

Finally, I will update the `drawer_side` module to use the array for the pilot hole offsets.

### Model

All modifications are complete. I've updated the constants and modules as requested, using common dimensions for pilot holes and specific offset arrays for clarity and maintainability. The task is finished.

### Session Summary

1.  **Initial Request: Documentation Update**
    You started by asking me to update the project's documentation files (`prompt/model-v2.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `README.md`) and prepare a commit message. The goal was to document the addition of several new features to the 3D model, namely a pedestal, an HDF back panel, and glass doors for the bookcase. I analyzed the `model.scad` file to understand these new features and then updated the documentation accordingly.

2.  **Cut List Generation: Planning**
    Next, you asked me to create a plan for generating a CSV cut list for all the panels in the model. I created a detailed plan that specified the CSV columns, panel details, materials, dimensions, and edge banding requirements. You then asked for an updated plan with more detailed "premium finish" edge banding and the suggestion to use OpenSCAD itself to generate the CSV file. I provided this updated plan, which you then asked me to save to `artifacts/cut-list-plan.md`.

3.  **Cut List Generation: Implementation**
    You then instructed me to proceed with code generation based on the plan. I implemented the cut list generation feature by:
    *   Adding a `generate_cut_list()` module to the `model.scad` file, controlled by a `generate_cut_list_csv` boolean variable. This module prints the cut list data to the OpenSCAD console.
    *   Initially modifying the `generate-csv.bat` file to correctly parse the output from OpenSCAD.
    *   You then requested that I rewrite the batch file as a PowerShell script, `generate-csv.ps1`, and expressed a preference for PowerShell for future tasks. I created the new PowerShell script.

4.  **Second Documentation Update**
    After the implementation of the cut list feature, you asked me to update the documentation again. I updated `prompt/model-v2.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `README.md` to include information about the new cut list generation feature and how to use the `generate-csv.ps1` script. I also prepared a new commit message for these changes.

5.  **`conversation.md` and Current Request**
    Finally, you asked me to update the `artifacts/conversation.md` file with the traces of our conversation. I explained that due to privacy and security constraints, I cannot access the raw log of our conversation history to perform this task. This led to our current point, where you have asked for this summary.
