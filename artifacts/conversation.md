### Model

I have updated the `GEMINI.md` file with the detailed description from `prompt-v2.md`.

> Use the following redering of the model to fix the model. The corpus is one plane and the shelves and drawers are in another. @artifacts/renderings/01-error.png

### Model

Okay, I see the problem. The rendering shows that the two main components of the furniture are not aligned correctly. I will examine the `model.scad` file to find the cause of this and fix it.

I have corrected the `model.scad` file. The changes should fix the alignment issues seen in the rendering. You can now re-render the model in OpenSCAD to see the corrected 3D model.

> Introduce debugging flags for selectivly showing different types of components.

### Model

Good idea. That will make it much easier to debug and inspect the model.

I will add boolean flags to control the visibility of the following component types:

*   Corpus
*   Drawers
*   Drawer Fronts
*   Slides
*   Shelves

You will be able to turn each of these on or off by changing a `true` or `false` value at the top of the `model.scad` file. I will now modify the file to add these flags.

I have added the debugging flags to the `model.scad` file. You can now selectively display the different components of the model by changing the boolean values at the top of the file.

> Instead of using the if statements in the main code for selectively showing components in the drawing, use functions to separate the drawing code and not pollute the main logic of structuring the model.

### Model

You're right, that's a much better way to structure the code. It will keep the main assembly section clean and easy to understand.

I will refactor the `model.scad` file to use modules for drawing each major component group. The `if (show_...)` logic will be moved inside these modules.

Here's how I'll restructure the assembly portion of the code:

1.  Create a `draw_corpus()` module.
2.  Create a `draw_drawers_assembly()` module that handles drawing the drawers, slides, and fronts.
3.  Create a `draw_shelves()` module.
4.  The main assembly logic will then simply be calls to these three new modules.

I will now modify the `model.scad` file.

I have refactored the `model.scad` file to use separate drawing modules for the corpus, drawers assembly, and shelves. The main logic is now cleaner and the visibility of each component group is controlled by the boolean flags at the top of the file.

> Do the same for drawers, slides and fronts.

### Model

Of course. I'll break down the `draw_drawers_assembly` module into more specific modules for `drawers`, `slides`, and `fronts` to further improve the code's structure and clarity.

I will now modify the `model.scad` file to implement this change.

I have refactored the `model.scad` file as requested. The `draw_drawers_assembly` module has been broken down into `draw_drawers`, `draw_slides`, and `draw_fronts`. The main assembly section of the code is now cleaner and more modular.

> Write a clear and detailed description of the model to @prompt/model-v2.md summarizing all the design decisions.

### Model

I will create a new file, `prompt/model-v2.md`, that contains a detailed description of the model and a summary of the design decisions that have been implemented.

I have created the `prompt/model-v2.md` file with a detailed description of the model and a summary of the design decisions.

> The fronts are not postioned correctly. They are now positoned inside the corpus but should be in front of corpus, leaning on the side panels when the drawer has been closed.

### Model

You are absolutely right. My apologies, I should have caught that. The drawer fronts are currently being placed inside the corpus instead of on the front face.

I will correct the `y` coordinate in the `draw_fronts` module to position them correctly in front of the main carcase. The back of the drawer fronts will be flush with the front of the corpus.

I will now modify the `model.scad` file.

I have corrected the `y` coordinate for the drawer fronts in the `model.scad` file. They should now be positioned correctly in front of the corpus.
