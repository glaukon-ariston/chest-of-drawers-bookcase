> Create pilot holes in corpus sides for fixing drawer slides. The holes should be 2mm deep and 2.5mm wide. There are six holes running on the slide's central line. The holes' offsets from the front edge are as follows: 6.5mm, 35mm, 51mm, 76mm, 99mm, and 115mm. Create constants with descriptive names for all the specified dimensions.

### Model

I will add the pilot holes for the drawer slides. First, I'll define the constants for the hole dimensions and offsets. Then, I'll modify the `corpus_side` module to create the holes and update the `corpus` module to correctly position them on both sides.

> Do not delete the previous constants related to slides pilot holes. They are for the drawer side, these new ones are for the corpus side. Name and rename the constants appropriatelly to reflect this requirement.

### Model

You are right. I should have noticed that. My apologies. I will correct my approach.

I will rename the existing slide pilot hole constants to specify they are for the drawer side. Then, I will add the new constants for the corpus side pilot holes. I will also create separate modules for the drawer and corpus pilot holes to ensure clarity and correctness. Finally, I will modify the `corpus_side` and `corpus` modules as planned.

### User

> Use the array syntax for the drawer slide pilot holes too.

### Model

Understood. I will use the array syntax for the drawer slide pilot holes to maintain consistency. I will now proceed with all the planned modifications.

### User

> Use the common constants for pilot hole depth, diameter and radius.

### Model

Excellent point. Using common constants for shared dimensions is a much better approach. I will update the code to use a single set of constants for the pilot hole dimensions and specific offset arrays for the drawer and corpus sides. This will simplify the code and improve maintainability. I will now proceed with this refined plan.

### Model

Now that I've updated the constants, I'll proceed with the other changes.

First, I'll update the `corpus_side` module to add the pilot holes. Then I'll update the `corpus` module to correctly call the modified `corpus_side` module. Finally, I'll update the `drawer_side` module to use the new array for the drawer slide pilot hole offsets.

I will start with the `corpus_side` module.

### Model

Okay, updating the `corpus` module now.

### Model

Finally, I will update the `drawer_side` module to use the array for the pilot hole offsets.

### Model

All modifications are complete. I've updated the constants and modules as requested, using common dimensions for pilot holes and specific offset arrays for clarity and maintainability. The task is finished.
