## Description

The model is a parametric 3D model of a piece of furniture combining a six-drawer chest of drawers with a bookcase on top. The bookcase is enclosed by two glass doors.

The OpenSCAD code is structured in a modular way to allow for easy customization and debugging. You can selectively show or hide different components of the model by changing the boolean flags at the top of the `model.scad` file.

## Usage

To view and customize the 3D model, open the `model.scad` file in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/).

The `prompt/model-v2.md` file contains a detailed description of the model and the design decisions.
